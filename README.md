Hello! I am a Graduate Student in Data Science from Saint Peterâ€™s University. While my coursework primarily focuses on Data Science, my true passion lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its applications in Large Language Models (LLMs). My professional journey began as a ML Developer at Wipro, followed by roles at Cyient and Saint Peter's. However, I struggled to find work that truly sparked my curiosity. It was during the COVID-19 lockdown that I discovered my interest in Data Science. Through self-study, I delved deeper into the field, which eventually led me to pursue a Masterâ€™s in Data Science.

During my graduate studies, my fascination with Transformers and Advanced NLP grew, especially after exploring Mohit Iyyerâ€™s Advanced NLP sessions. His work inspired me to dive deeper into LLMs, their architectures, and real-world applications. Currently, I am actively researching Natural Language Processing, focusing on the inner workings of Neural Language Models and their advancements. My goal is to deepen my expertise and contribute to the evolving field of NLP and AI.
