Hello! I am a Graduate Student in Data Science from Saint Peter‚Äôs University. While my coursework primarily focuses on Data Science, my true passion lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its applications in Large Language Models (LLMs). My professional journey began as a ML Developer at TechnoVision Digitech Pvt Ltd (India), followed by roles at Saint Peter's and Infosoft Solutions (US). However, I struggled to find work that truly sparked my curiosity. It was during the COVID-19 lockdown that I discovered my interest in Data Science. Through self-study, I delved deeper into the field, which eventually led me to pursue a Master‚Äôs in Data Science.

During my graduate studies, my fascination with Transformers and Advanced NLP grew, especially after exploring Mohit Iyyer‚Äôs Advanced NLP sessions. His work inspired me to dive deeper into LLMs, their architectures, and real-world applications. Currently, I am actively researching Natural Language Processing, focusing on the inner workings of Neural Language Models and their advancements. My goal is to deepen my expertise and contribute to the evolving field of NLP and AI.
